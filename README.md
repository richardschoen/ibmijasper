# IBM i JasperReports Report Generation Commands  
Since 2007 I have done a lot of work building reports and forms using the JasperReports library in conjunction with IBM i, so I can attest to Jasper as a stable Java based report and form creation engine.   

This GitHub repository will be used to house a few sample CL commands, Java sample code and Jasper report templates for generating JasperReports from the IBM i command line or as part of an existing application if desired.    

The IBMIJASPER library packages a forked copy of the Java files that are part of Pete Helgren's Report Generator project.   

# Pre-requisites
You must install the QShell on i library - QSHONI

You must download and install the IBMIJASPER library  

# Training and Support for IBMIJASPER
If you desire assistance in setting up the IBMIJASPER library so you can generate reports and data exports from your IBM i system, feel free to reach out about consulting assistance.
