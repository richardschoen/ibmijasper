# IBM i Jasper Report Samples
Since 2007 I have done a lot of work building reports and forms using the JasperReports library, so I can attest it as a stable report bulding platform.   

This repo will be used to house a few sample CL commands, Java sample code and Jasper report templates for generating JasperReports from the IBM i command line.

JasperReports is an open-source report generation library for Java that has been available since 2001. Jaspersoft was acquired by Tibco in 2014.

JasperReports Studio and the JasperReports Java library are available for FREE from Tibco.

THE IBMIJASPER library packages a forked copy of the Java files that are part of Pete Helgren's Report Generator project.
